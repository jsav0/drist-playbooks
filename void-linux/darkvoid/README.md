# darkvoid playbook
provisions a void linux host for recon and offensive hacking  

## Basic usage
1. define target in config.mk
2. run make
3. that's it

# Example
```
echo 'SERVERS = void@67.205.155.81' > config.mk && make
```

this mimicks my ansible darkvoid playbook, but drist is more simple, seriously.
